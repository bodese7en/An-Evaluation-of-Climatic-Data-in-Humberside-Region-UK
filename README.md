# Soil Moisture Analysis with Boxplot Visualization

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and data files for analyzing soil moisture content across different depths using boxplot visualizations. 
The goal is to gain insights into the distribution of soil moisture at various depths and identify potential patterns or trends.

## Data

The dataset includes soil moisture measurements collected at different depths in a study area. 
Each row represents a sampling point, and columns include depth levels and corresponding moisture values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Plotly Express
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided example notebook)
